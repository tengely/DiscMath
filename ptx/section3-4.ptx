  <title>Pigeonhole principle</title>
  <p>
    In this section we study the so-called pigeonhole principle which is a simple tool to prove several interesting results.
    First we prove the simplest form of the pigeonhole principle.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>n+1</m> pigeons are placed into <m>n</m> pigeonholes,
        then there exists a pigeonhole containing at least 2 pigeons.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume that the statement is false.
      That is, each pigeonhole contains at most one pigeon.
      In this case the total number of pigeons is at most <m>n</m>,
      a contradiction.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    One can easily generalize the above theorem.
    We have the following.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>mn+1</m> pigeons are placed into <m>n</m> pigeonholes,
        then there exists a pigeonhole containing at least <m>m+1</m> pigeons.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Again we prove the statement by contradiction.
      Assume that the statement is false,
      that is, each pigeonhole contains at most <m>m</m> pigeons.
      We obtain that the total number of pigeons is at most <m>mn</m>,
      a contradiction since there are <m>mn+1</m> pigeons.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    Finally we prove a version where the pigeonholes may contain different number of pigeons.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="pigeon-III">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_n</m> are positive integers.
        If <m>m_1+m_2+\ldots+m_n-n+1</m> pigeons are placed into <m>n</m> pigeonholes,
        then for some <m>1\leq i\leq n</m> one has that the <m>i</m>th pigeonhole contains at least <m>m_i</m> pigeons.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose that the first pigeonhole contains at most <m>m_1-1</m> pigeons,
      the second contains at most <m>m_2-1</m> pigeons etc., the
      <m>n</m>th pigeonhole contains at most <m>m_n-1</m> pigeons.
      The total number of pigeons contained in the <m>n</m> pigeonholes can be at most
      <me>
        (m_1-1)+(m_2-1)+\ldots+(m_n-1)=m_1+m_2+\ldots+m_n-n
      </me>,
      a contradiction since there are <m>m_1+m_2+\ldots+m_n-n+1</m> pigeons.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    To apply the pigeonhole principle one has to decide what the pigeons are.
    Then one has to identify the pigeonholes in such a way that if two pigeons are in the same pigeonhole,
    then they have some special property in common.
    It is important that we need more pigeons than pigeonholes.
    In what follows we solve several concrete problems by using the pigeonhole principle.
  </p>

  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        There is a nonzero multiple of 6 whose digits are all zeroes and ones.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>

  <proof>
    <p>
      We apply the pigeonhole principle and the Division algorithm.
      Consider the integers <m>a_n=\sum_{k=0}^n 10^k</m> for <m>n=0,1,2,3,4,5</m>.
      We can write these numbers as <m>q_n\cdot 6+r_n</m>,
      where <m>q_n</m> is the quotient and <m>r_n</m> is the remainder,
      so <m>0\leq r_n\lt 6</m>.
      There are six possibilities for <m>r_n</m> and there are six integers <m>a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_5</m>.
      The numbers <m>a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_5</m> are odd integers while 6 is even,
      hence <m>r_n\neq 0</m> for all <m>n</m>.
      We have that <m>r_n\in\halmaz{1,2,3,4,5}</m> for all <m>n</m>.
      There are only 5 pigeonholes
      (possible remainders)
      and 6 pigeons (integers <m>a_n</m>).
      We obtain that there are at least two integers having the same remainder, say,
      <m>a_{m_1}</m> and <m>a_{m_2}</m>, where <m>m_1\lt m_2</m>.
      In this case <m>a_{m_2}-a_{m_1}</m> is divisible by 6 and all the digits are zeroes and ones.

      It is clear that <m>r_0=r_3=1</m>,
      therefore <m>a_3-a_0=1111-1=1110</m> is a multiple of 6 (<m>1110=185\cdot 6</m>) and this integer is in a right form.

  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a set containing <m>n\geq 2</m> integers.
        There is a subset of <m>A</m> such that the sum of its elements is a multiple of <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>

  <proof>
    <p>
      We have a set containing <m>n</m> elements,
      let us say these are <m>a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n</m>.
      We define <m>n</m> subsets as follows
      <me>
        S_k=\halmaz{a_1,\ldots,a_k}, k=1,2,\ldots,n
      </me>,
      that is, <m>S_1=\halmaz{a_1}, S_2=\halmaz{a_1,a_2},\ldots,S_n=A</m>.
      Denote by <m>s_k</m> the sum of the elements of <m>S_k</m>.
      We apply the
      Division algorithm to write <m>s_k=q_k\cdot n+r_k</m>,
      where <m>0\leq r_k\lt n</m>.
      If for some <m>k</m> we have <m>r_k=0</m>, then
      <me>
        s_k=a_1+\ldots+a_k=q_k\cdot n
      </me>,
      that is, the sum of the elements of <m>S_k</m> is a multiple of <m>n</m>.
      In this case the theorem is true.
      If no such
      <m>k</m> exists,
      then we have only <m>n-1</m> possible values for <m>r_k</m> and we have <m>n</m> subsets.
      The pigeonhole principle says
      that there are at least two subsets
      (say <m>S_k</m> and <m>S_l, k\lt l</m>)
      for which <m>r_k=r_l</m>.
      In this case we obtain that
      <me>
        s_l-s_k=(q_l-q_k)n=a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}+\ldots+a_l
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus the sum of the elements of the subset
      <m>\halmaz{a_{k+1},a_{k+2},\ldots,a_l}</m> is a multiple of <m>n</m>.
